        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Smash Burger's that is the only to descripbe this burger. The best burgers comes with freedom with some salt, the beef's best friend.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef (preferably 80% lean)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon canola oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground pepper, divided</li>
            <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
            <li>Optional: Mayonnaise, sliced American cheese, sliced tomato, dill pickle slices, lettuce, ketchup and yellow mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a 9-in. cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Meanwhile, gently shape beef into 4 balls, shaping just enough to keep together (do not compact). </li>
            <li>Increase burner temperature to medium-high; add oil. Working in batches, add beef. With a heavy metal spatula, flatten to 1/4- to 1/2-in. thickness; sprinkle each with 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook until edges start to brown, about 1-1/2 minutes. Turn burgers and sprinkle with additional 1/8 teaspoon salt and pepper. Cook until well browned and a thermometer reads at least 160Â°, 1 minute. Repeat with remaining beef.</li>
            <li>Serve burgers on buns with toppings as desired.</li>
        </ol>
